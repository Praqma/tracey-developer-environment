# Send events script and json Templates

To send a few events just run:

`sayAll`

It uses `scc.json` and `scs.json` and some jar-files you need to download here first by running `download-cli-tools.sh`

For send configuration it uses the `default.cfg` file for host of the RabbitMQ.

Connect to the web you of RabbitMQ on [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672).

Use port `5682` send on, see `default.cfg` file
